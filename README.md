# What is Valorant Stats Checker?
Valorant Stats Checker is a refreshingly simple data-driven app. The purpose for this app is to easily access the data from your own or anybody elses last couple of matches and it is free!

# WARNING
Valorant Stats Checker app is still in the very early stages of development. APIs can and will change. Important features are currently missing. 

# Design Goals
Capable: Offer a free easy to use and access website, that fetches information and contains databases.
Simple: Easy for anybody to use 
Data Focused: Data-oriented architecture
Fast: App logic should run quickly, and when possible, in parallel
